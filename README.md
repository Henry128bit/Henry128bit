## Hi there 👋 :octocat:

### **Frontend development**

### **About me**
---
I am new to programming and currently learning front-end development. 👨‍🎓 💻 Until recently, I lived in Russia and repaired musical instruments, 🎸 but now I am in Georgia and I am trying to find my first job in a new direction for me. A couple of years ago I **completed courses from Yandex**, but then I had good opportunities to develop in another area and I decided to wait with a career in IT. Unfortunately, during this time I forgot a lot and now I remember what I forgot .. but I firmly decided to become a programmer this year! I hope I succeed :crossed_fingers::muscle:

Now I am taking a course on **JavaScript** and **REACT** on **Udemy**, but **I can** already **make good layout** and **use Bootstrap**. Well, as you noticed, I know how to use **GIT**.
