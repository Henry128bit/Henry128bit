## Hi there 👋 :octocat:

### **Frontend development**

### **About me**
---
My name is Sergey and I'm studying frontend. 👨‍🎓 💻 Until recently, I lived in Russia and repaired musical instruments, 🎸 but now I am in Dubai and I am trying to find my first job in a new direction for me.

Now I'm learning JavaScript and React, but I can already make good layout and use Bootstrap. Well, as you noticed, I know how to use GIT.

### **Skills and Experience**
